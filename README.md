mitWeather is a weather application that I developed to put into practice everything I learned about React, Redux, ModuleCSS, Fetch API and React Router.  The application allows you to obtain the current weather of any location and its extended forecast by querying the openweathermaps API, keeping the latest searches and being able to quickly change them. The interface adapts to weather conditions resulting in a formidable visual experience.
